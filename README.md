# Digital Logic Gates using Verilog and Cadence

This repository contains the RTL design and functional verification of fundamental digital logic gates using Verilog HDL. Each module is simulated in Cadence environment with dedicated testbenches and waveform validation.
This repository contains the design and functional verification of fundamental digital logic gates using Verilog HDL. Each gate is implemented at RTL level and simulated in Cadence environment with dedicated testbenches and waveform analysis.
